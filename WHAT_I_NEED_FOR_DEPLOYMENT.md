# 🚀 What I Need to Deploy Your App

Since MCP resources aren't available for Supabase/Vercel, I'll guide you through the deployment process. Here's what we need:

## ✅ What's Already Ready

- ✅ Build successful (`npm run build` works)
- ✅ `vercel.json` configured
- ✅ `supabase/schema.sql` ready
- ✅ GitHub repository connected (`mbangabad/GenRizz`)
- ✅ All code committed and pushed

## 📋 What I Need From You

If you already have Supabase and Vercel accounts, provide:

1. **Supabase Project URL**

2. **Supabase Anon Key**
   - Format: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
   - Where to find: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → anon public

3. **Vercel Account Status**
   - Do you have a Vercel account?
   - Is it connected to your GitHub?

If you need to create accounts, I'll provide step-by-step instructions for:
- Creating Supabase project
